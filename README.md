# MSSE_CMPE285
Lab and projects for course CMPE285 of MSSE program.


## Lab: Software Development Process
### Background
Your group is the up-and-coming startup team. You are funded 100k USD to develop the following product.

### Product:
A geotarget mobile application that will locate the cheapest restaurant around you with a certain type of food.


### Questions
Define the roles of your team. Describe who is going to do what, etc.
Describe how you are going to spend the money.
Pick a development process that your group is going to use for the product. Explain your choice.

### Answer (The development process)
We will use Kanban process at first and then switch to Scrum as our application becomes stable. At the beginning, we need to test our concept and get feedback ASAP, Kanban enables us to deliver shippable updates almost anytime, and we can respond to the market right away. Comparing to Scrum process, we donâ€™t have to wait until the next sprint begins to start working on new tasks.

During Kanban process, we will do experiment to find the most suitable WIP and release cycle for our team, For example, we may start with a 4-task WIP, if it turns out that we can finish our work really fast and the average lead time looks good, we can increase the WIP limit to 6 or even more until we find there are too many tasks in the workflow. Such experiment will make sure our workflow has an optimal WIP.

Once our application demo is published and the system runs smoothly, we can start switch from Kanban to a more stable process in order to make our release predictable. Scrum requires a fixed period of time for each release so that we can have a more reliable budget plan. When we switch to Scrum development process, we will set the sprint length based on our experience from Kanban. The main difference is that we will plan each sprint to decide how many tasks and which task should be put into the current sprint, and avoid adding new tasks to the current workflow.

In addition, in case that there are emergencies in our development process, we can adopt pair programming to minimize the number of bug in some key modules. We will also set at least 2 rounds of code review, the number of code review may increase or decrease depending on the level of task and status of the current sprint. A code refactoring task will be performed every a few sprints to continuously improve the code quality.
